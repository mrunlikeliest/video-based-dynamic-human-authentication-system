# video-based-dynamic-human-authentication-system
To develop a software soluton which will dynamically record the date and time of a person who passed through the gate.

It will have all the data of person like name and all facial values to verify and
process it.

We can use face recognition for the purpose of keeping record of the person
entering exists a technology for face recognition based authentication,
dynamic human recognition based authentication is highly challenging. For a
given entrance gate a software solution is needed to identify every unique
person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time,
photo/videos recorded.
